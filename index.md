# What is Expertise Style Transfer?
Prvasive cognitive bias exhibited across all domains can lead to discrepancies between an expert’s advice and a layman’s understanding of it. To tackle this problem, we propose a new task of text style transfer between expert language and layman language, namely **Expertise Style Transfer** (EST), and contribute a manually annotated dataset in the medical domain for this task.
